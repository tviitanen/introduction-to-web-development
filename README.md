# Introduction to web development
This game is developed for LUT University course 'Introduction to web programming' in autumn 2022.

## BASIC JUMPER
@author tviitanen

In this project, Phaser3 library is used to develop
a simple game. There is boot screen, mainmenu. From mainmenu
you can start playing by clicking a button.

In game, there is an option for user to pause game and
to return to mainmenu (currently not working, game freezes).

### PLOT

In the game, the goal is to collect stars. Each yellow star gives you
10 points. When all yellow stars are collected, new stars are dropped
to game. Also, bomb is added to the game. If bomb touches you, it's
game over. On the ground, there is an enemy tracking your location
and trying to kill you. From red star you can get more points and spawn
to a new map, but it is not required to collect (new stars are dropped anyway).
Second map has more enemies, but you get more points by collecting stars.

### DEVELOPMENT

Game is created in codesandbox, and can be tested straight from
https://codesandbox.io/s/phaser-project-4jb1s3

This game is created with vanilla js. Also Phaser 3.55.2 library is
used in development. Process included lot of learning and searching
since this is my first game project. Filestructure is so that from
src-folder you can find all the .js files. In assets folder there is 
pictures and sounds. Pictures are used for character, enemy, bomb and menu.
Sounds are in assets/sounds folder and those are used for in-game audio.
There is many scenes/js files, since I wanted to try how to create game
with multiple .js files. Also that gives me better play ground if I wish
to develop this game even further. Simple phaser-template is used for file-
structure, which can be found on phaser documents.

Hardest parts in development was probably dealing with the scenes and
starting new map.


## GRADING

Report is written carefully and contains all the important staff. 2p

Game has clear plot and function (collect stars/points). Game gets harder
further you keep playing since the amount of bomb increases in each round. 4p

Application works on most used browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). 2p

Application is responsible and all the files are not in the same folder
(no minus points).

Application has a logical filestucture good for further development.
Also code is well commented making it more readable and understandable. 2p.

There are different kind of enemies/objects which can hurt the player. 3p

There are sound effects on the game. (Annoying) backgound music, sound when
jumping, collecting stars and hitting to enemy/bomb 3p

There are more than one map. Second map has the same basic idea but is harder
to play. 3p

There are moving platforms on the game. (Second map) 3p

=== TOTAL: 22p


TODO:
Users can get their name on the scoreboard. 3p

There are different kind of objects to collect with different kind of points
and plenty of them. 2p

Kill an enemy xp

bugs:
Pause.js move to mainmenu is not working
enemy sprite does not turn
